# DW3005T - Linear power supply 2

This is the second iteration of my linear power supply project [available on GitHub](https://github.com/Dominik-Workshop/Linear_power_supply), building upon the foundation of my original design. While the first version served as an excellent learning experience, the DW3005T aims to improve upon its predecessor with enhanced performance, better stability, and a more professional design.
